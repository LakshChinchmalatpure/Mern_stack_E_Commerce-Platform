## ✨ Features & Architecture

### 🛍️ Client & Customer Experience
- **Fluid Grid Interface**: Built on a modular Swiss layout using Tailwind CSS, featuring subtle hover expansions and micro-interactions powered by `motion` (Framer Motion).
- **Gemini AI Smart Picks**: Fully integrated with the Google GenAI SDK. If a model encounters a high-demand limit, our API automatically heals, cycling through redundant high-performing candidates (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-flash-latest`) to secure smart product recommendations.
- **Dynamic Context Search & Filters**: Search, browse, and filter items by price ranges, high ratings, categories, and inventory instantly.
- **Smart Shopping Bag**: Seamless checkout pipeline with live total computation, visual item counters, and flexible cart actions.
- **Flexible Checkout Flow**: Supports standard secure integration. If your `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is not present, the app gracefully deploys a gorgeous, fully responsive checkout simulator.

### ⚙️ Admin Control Center (Power Dashboard)
- **JWT Secured Login**: Restricts entry using high-entropy passwords secured through industrial-grade salt-and-hash algorithms (`bcryptjs`) and secure `jsonwebtoken` cookies.
- **Real-Time Catalog Management**: Full CRUD capabilities to instantly create new products, adjust inventory counts, update descriptions, and replace Unsplash high-resolution URLs.
- **Dynamic Database Healing**: Our backend system automatically backfills missing catalog records on startup so that your workspace remains fully healthy and updated.
- **Interactive Analytics**: Monitor sales, overall reviews, average ratings, low-stock warnings, and hot-selling categories directly from a high-contrast panel.
